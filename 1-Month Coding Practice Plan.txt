1-Month Coding Practice Plan
Week 1: Fundamental Recall & Daily Coding

    Day 1-2: Data Structures (Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, Queues, Stacks)
    Day 3-4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism
    Day 5-6: Common C# Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, String Manipulation)
    Day 7: Mini Project - Build a small console app (e.g., a To-Do list)

Week 2: ASP.NET MVC & Backend Logic

    Day 8-9: MVC Basics (Controllers, Models, Views, Routing)
    Day 10-11: Entity Framework & LINQ (CRUD without referencing documentation)
    Day 12-13: Authentication & Middleware (JWT, Session, Cookies)
    Day 14: Build a Simple CRUD Web App without reference

Week 3: Problem-Solving & Algorithms

    Day 15-16: LeetCode Easy & Medium Problems (Focus on C# solutions)
    Day 17-18: System Design Basics (Explain how youâ€™d build an app)
    Day 19-20: Debugging & Optimizing Code
    Day 21: Take a full-length mock coding test (No internet)

Week 4: Simulating Interview Scenarios

    Day 22-23: Whiteboard-style coding (Solve problems on paper first)
    Day 24-25: Build a small project under a time limit
    Day 26-27: Mock Interviews (Time-bound coding challenges)
    Day 28-30: Revise, identify weak points, and retake mock assessments

Guidelines to Follow

    Write code daily without looking up solutions
    Use paper first, then implement in Visual Studio
    Use LeetCode, CodeSignal, and C# console apps for testing
    Mimic real interviews by solving problems under timed conditions



Day 1-2: Data Structures in C#

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Implement fundamental data structures from scratch.

âœ… Tasks:

    Arrays
        Create a program that finds the second largest number in an array.
        Implement a function that removes duplicates from an array.
        Reverse an array without using built-in functions.

    Lists
        Create a custom LinkedList class with methods: Add, Remove, Find.
        Implement a method that removes even numbers from a List<int>.

    Dictionaries
        Implement a frequency counter: Count occurrences of words in a string.
        Create a simple caching system using Dictionary<int, string>.

    Stacks & Queues
        Implement a stack using an array.
        Implement a queue using a linked list.
        Implement a balanced parentheses checker using a stack.

Day 3-4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Implement key OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction).

âœ… Tasks:

    Class & Object Basics
        Create a Car class with properties (Brand, Model, Speed) and methods (Accelerate(), Brake()).
        Write a BankAccount class with deposit, withdraw, and balance check methods.

    Encapsulation & Inheritance
        Modify the BankAccount class to include a derived class SavingsAccount with interest rate calculation.

    Polymorphism
        Create an interface IShape with a method GetArea(). Implement Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle classes.

    Abstract Classes & Method Overriding
        Create an abstract class Animal with an abstract method MakeSound(). Implement Dog and Cat classes.

Day 5-6: Common C# Algorithms

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Implement algorithms without using built-in methods.

âœ… Tasks:

    Sorting Algorithms
        Implement Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort.
        Sort a list of Employee objects based on salary.

    Searching Algorithms
        Implement Binary Search (Iterative & Recursive).
        Implement a simple hash function for storing values.

    String Manipulation
        Reverse a string without using built-in methods.
        Check if a string is a palindrome.
        Find the most frequent character in a string.

Day 7: Mini Project - Console-Based To-Do List App

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Combine the weekâ€™s learning into a small project.

âœ… Tasks:

    Create a To-Do List Console App with the following features:
        Add a new task.
        Remove a task.
        Mark a task as completed.
        List all tasks with their status.

ðŸš€ Bonus Challenge:

    Save tasks in a text file and load them when the program starts.
